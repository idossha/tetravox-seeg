# Every asset is uploaded **under its own sha256**, which is the layout Tetravox already uses for
# sample data (`scripts/sample-data/publish.sh`, "an asset's content is its name, so re-uploading can
# only ever be a no-op or a mistake") and what lets the app verify a download against its own URL. A
# human-named copy goes up beside it so a person reading the release page can tell what they are
# looking at; nothing reads it, and the app never fetches it.
#
# What it prints is not decoration: the `modules.lock` fragment is what Tetravox's release bundles,
# and the registry `versions[]` entry is what `idossha/tetravox-extensions` serves to File ▸
# Extensions…. Both carry the same hashes as the assets, and the app refuses any file whose bytes do
# not match.
