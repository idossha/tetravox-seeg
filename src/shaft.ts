/**
 * The geometry of a **depth electrode**, as opposed to the geometry of any contact set.
 *
 * The SDK's contacts kit (`contacts.fitLine`) fits the line; this file knows what an sEEG shaft
 * *is*: a rigid rod pushed through the skull, contacts evenly spaced along it, numbered **1 at the
 * deepest end**. Every rule below is a fact about that hardware and about a head, which is exactly
 * why none of it belongs in the shared kit — that kit stays in the app and serves every contact
 * module, and a second contact module is a library's user, not a fork.
 *
 * ## The tip rule, stated
 *
 * Slicer's `_tipSign` is a **stub**: its docstring describes a heuristic and its body is
 * `return 1.0  # neutral default`, so "Renumber tip-first" there numbers from whichever end the line
 * fit happened to point at, and the module's own README lists "verify contact 1 = deepest" as a known
 * limitation. This build implements the heuristic the docstring describes, and states it:
 *
 * > **Contact 1 is the end of the shaft nearer the reference centre; the entry is the end farther
 * > from it.** The reference is the centre of the bound volume's bounding box — the head, near
 * > enough — falling back to the centroid of every contact in the set when there is no volume.
 *
 * Why that reference and not the electrode's own centroid: a shaft's own centroid lies *between* its
 * ends, so both ends are about equidistant from it and the rule would be a coin toss. The head's
 * centre is the thing "deep" is measured against, and every shaft is inserted from the outside
 * inward. It is a **heuristic**, not a brain mask: an occipital shaft entering close to the midline
 * can defeat it, which is why the tip is shown in the panel, `t` flips it, and **nothing renumbers
 * implicitly** — see below.
 *
 * ## What renumbers, and what does not
 *
 * Only **Re-fit** and **Renumber tip-first** ever change a contact's number or name. Loading a table,
 * placing a contact, dragging one, snapping and deleting all leave the numbering exactly as it was.
 * So a clinical table's numbering — which is wired to the recording system through `csc` — can only
 * be changed by a button that says it changes it. Re-fit relabels because that is what Slicer's
 * Re-fit does and what its label promises; it does not re-derive the tip, it uses the electrode's
 * current one.
