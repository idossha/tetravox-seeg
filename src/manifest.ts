/**
 * `tetravox.seeg` — the sEEG contact editor (Tetravox ARCHITECTURE.md §13).
 *
 * The first product module, and the first one to live outside the Tetravox repository: an
 * Inputs → Edit → Save loop over a BIDS-iEEG `electrodes.tsv` and the registered CT it was localised
 * on, reproducing the 3D Slicer `SEEGContactEditor` a lab already uses
 * (`seegprep/slicer/SEEGContactEditor/`) inside Tetravox's own panes.
 *
 * **Data only**, like every manifest: type annotations and object literals, no DOM type and no
 * import but the SDK's `ModuleManifest` type, because the app's main process validates a
 * `type: "module"` job action against the installed manifests before a window exists (§13.6).
 * `scripts/emit-manifest.mjs` turns this file into the `manifest.json` a release ships, and the
 * SDK's own validator is what says the JSON is a manifest.
 *
 * **Every scene-mutating command is also an operation**, which is §13.6's "there is no
 * automation-only code path" applied to a module: the `operations` below are what a job file drives,
 * and each one is the same function the panel's button calls. The commands that are *not* operations
 * are the ones with no meaning without a person, and there is a rule rather than a list: a command
 * that needs a **live pointer** (`add` arms place mode), a **file sheet** (`save-as`), the session's
 * own **undo stack** (`undo`, `redo`), or that only moves the **selection** (`next`, `prev`) has
 * nothing to do in a batch run; `snap-electrode` and `snap-all` are the `snap` operation's `scope`.
 * `test/manifest.test.ts` holds this manifest to that rule, so a scene-mutating command added without an
 * operation fails the build rather than becoming an automation-only gap.
 *
 * **Command ids are kebab-case, not camelCase.** The manifest validator requires every contributed id to
 * match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` — the shape the host namespaces as `<moduleId>/<id>` — so `snap-electrode`
 * rather than `snapElectrode`. The **operation** ids, which are the half §13.6's job envelope names,
 * are unaffected.
 *
 * **The sibling patterns are the `seegprep` derivative layout.** The templates are duplicated in
 * `src/bids.ts`, which is what a data-only manifest costs; `test/bids.test.ts`
 * asserts the two agree, so a typo fails a test rather than quietly disabling a sibling.
