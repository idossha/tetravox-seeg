/**
 * The module's scene block — `ViewSpec.extensions['tetravox.seeg']` (ARCHITECTURE.md §13.2).
 *
 * **What the layer cannot carry.** The contacts themselves are ordinary `PointsLayer` points, so a
 * build without this module still draws them and still round-trips them. What a `points[]` entry has
 * no field for is *provenance*: which file the contact came from, where that file put it, what its
 * `status` cell said, and every other cell of its row. Without those, reopening a scene and pressing
 * Save would write a table in which every contact was `added` and every original column was gone.
 *
 * **Three rules make the block portable**, and each is checked here rather than assumed:
 *
 *  * it holds **no `LayerId` and no `DatasetId`** — both are reassigned on load, so it is keyed by
 *    `points[].id` and finds its layer by `LayerBase.module` instead;
 *  * it is **≤ 256 KiB of JSON**, enforced by the host. A 103-contact table is about 20 kB; a
 *    5 000-row one with seventeen columns is not, so {@link shrinkBlock} drops the per-row `extra`
 *    first and the whole `rows` map second, in that order, because losing the original columns is
 *    worse than losing nothing and better than losing the block;
 *  * a block **this build cannot read is not this build's to break** — `fromBlock` validates the
 *    shape of everything it uses and ignores everything it does not, so a newer module's extra keys
 *    survive a round trip through an older one only in the sense that they are dropped, never
 *    misread.
